== Available states

=== `java`

_Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)_.

This installs Java package, manages Java configuration file and then
configures the development environment.

=== `java.archive`

This state will install Java from archive only.

=== `java.macapp`

This state will install Java macpackage on MacOS only, if supplied by
provider.

=== `java.package`

This state installs default Java package supplied by OS if applicable
(not recommended).

=== `java.config`

This state will configure java and/or environment and has a dependency
on `java.install` via include list.

=== `java.config.linuxenv`

This state will setup Java linux-alternatives on GNU/Linux.

=== `java.clean`

_Meta-state (This is a state that includes other states)_.

this state will undo everything performed in the `java` meta-state in
reverse order, i.e. removes the configuration file and then uninstalls
the package.

=== `java.config.clean`

This state will remove the configuration of Java and has a dependency on
`java.package.clean` via include list.

=== `java.archive.clean`

This state will remove Java package and has a dependency on
`java.config.clean` via include list.

=== `java.macapp.clean`

This state will remove Java mapackage and has a dependency on
`java.config.clean` via include list.

=== `java.config.linuxenv.clean`

This state will remove Java linux-alternatives on GNU/Linux.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `java` main state, ready for
testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
